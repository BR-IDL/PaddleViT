## Installation
This module is tested on Python3.6+, and PaddlePaddle 2.1.0+. Most dependencies are installed by PaddlePaddle installation. You only need to install the following packages:
```shell
pip install yacs pyyaml
```
Then download the github repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/BR-IDL/PaddleViT.git
cd PaddleViT/image_classification
```
> Note: It is recommended to install the latest version of PaddlePaddle to avoid some CUDA errors for  PaddleViT training. For PaddlePaddle, please refer to this [link](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/zh/install/pip/linux-pip.html) for stable version installation and this [link](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/zh/develop/install/pip/linux-pip.html#gpu) for develop version installation. 

## Basic Usage
### Data Preparation
ImageNet2012 dataset is used in the following folder structure:
```
│imagenet/
├──train/
│  ├── n01440764
│  │   ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│  │   ├── n01440764_10027.JPEG
│  │   ├── ......
│  ├── ......
├──val/
│  ├── n01440764
│  │   ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│  │   ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00002138.JPEG
│  │   ├── ......
│  ├── ......
```
### Demo Example
To use the model with pretrained weights, go to the specific subfolder, then download the `.pdparam` weight file and change related file paths in the following python scripts. The model config files are located in `./configs/`.  

Assume the downloaded weight file is stored in `./vit_base_patch16_224.pdparams`, to use the `vit_base_patch16_224` model in python:
```python
from config import get_config
from visual_transformer import build_vit as build_model
# config files in ./configs/
config = get_config('./configs/vit_base_patch16_224.yaml')
# build model
model = build_model(config)
# load pretrained weights
model_state_dict = paddle.load('./vit_base_patch16_224.pdparams')
model.set_dict(model_state_dict)
```
> :robot: See the README file in each model folder for detailed usages.

## Basic Concepts
PaddleViT image classification module is developed in separate folders for each model with similar structure. Each implementation is around 3 type of classes and 2 types of scripts:
1. **Model classes** such as **[transformer.py](./ViT/transformer.py)**, in which the core *transformer model* and related methods are defined.
   
2. **Dataset classes** such as **[dataset.py](./ViT/datasets.py)**, in which the dataset, dataloader, data transforms are defined. We provided flexible implementations for you to customize the data loading scheme. Both single GPU and multi-GPU loading are supported.
   
3. **Config classes** such as **[config.py](./ViT/config.py)**, in which the model and training/validation configurations are defined. Usually, you don't need to change the items in the configuration, we provide updating configs by python `arguments` or `.yaml` config file. You can see [here](../docs/ppvit-config.md) for details of our configuration design and usage.
   
4. **main scripts** such as **[main_single_gpu.py](./ViT/main_single_gpu.py)**, in which the whole training/validation procedures are defined. The major steps of training or validation are provided, such as logging, loading/saving models, finetuning, etc. Multi-GPU is also supported and implemented in separate python script `main_multi_gpu.py`.
   
5. **run scripts** such as **[run_eval_base_224.sh](./ViT/run_eval_base_224.sh)**, in which the shell command for running python script with specific configs and arguments are defined.
